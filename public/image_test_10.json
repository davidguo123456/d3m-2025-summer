I found it kept me warm over an Alberta winter working on a dock, sometimes outdoors without a coat. But cool enough to wear in the evening during the warmer months of the year. It's currently my favourite hoody.",

It also fits smaller than stated, my wife likes men's sweatshirts and normally wears a medium because she prefers a loose fit but purchased a large and it is a snug fit. The quality seems to be good and she loves the color, just remember to go about 2 sizes up over store bought sweatshirts.",

It's very light, doesn't hang well and smelled of chemicals. So buyer beware. I'm not going to send it back as it's a pain to do so, but I will NEVER order a Hanes product from Amazon again.",
