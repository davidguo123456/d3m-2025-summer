            "Review Title": "These are actually American sizing and reasonable quality",
            "Review Body": "I ordered two, expecting that given the price, they would be \"Chinese Sizing\" as a lot of online clothing is. I'm quite a large guy, and take a 2XL American sizing, so it's hard to find clothing online. If I order a 2XL from most places, it turns out to be 2XL for Asian men. So more like an American Medium. Generally I find that if you go from Chinese produced clothing to American, you need to step down 2 sizes to get an accurate idea of what you are getting.So, I was expecting a 3XL to be about an XL. Nope. It really is a 3XL. So... they are a bit big on me, which is fine. I am sure that like most cotton clothing, they'll shrink a bit in the wash, and I like things a bit loose on me for comfort. So overall I am pleasantly surprised and am likely to order some more.A couple of minor issues:One of them, the threading came out of the seam on the collar in the package, leaving a one inch hole. It was the work of 2 minutes to mend it with a needle and thread, so not worth making a stink about. But it means the quality control is kinda poor. The second was fine.The other thing which is a bit disappointing... I ordered black. Their black is a very dark grey or light charcoal. It's what you would expect from a very faded black t-shirt. So if you want actual black, you'll maybe need to dye them.Overall however, and at the price, they are actually very good. They lose a star for the issues above, but honestly... knowing what I am going to get, I'll order again. I'll just have a bottle of Rit on hand to darken them, and maybe a needle and thread for the collars just in case.",
