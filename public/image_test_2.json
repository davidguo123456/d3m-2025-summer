            "Review Title": "My second pair of Sambas!",
            "Review Body": "I currently own a white pair of sambas and then saw the black ones listed on Amazon. The listing indicates that the size is unisex and I puchased size 6 which I believe is in men's sizing. I wear 8 - 8 1/2 US ladies shoe and found the size 6 suitable. I haven't worn them out yet and do anticipate that these will stretch out. In my own experience, the shoe does stretch out quite a bit so just something to be aware of when you purchase these shoes (Ex. If they already feel quite loose prior to being stretched out, you may want to size down). These shoes are great for walking, not too sure about long distances as the sole of the shoe is thin. I don't believe the insole can be removed so something to be mindful of if you need to slip on custom orthotics or insoles. These are cute and fashionable shoes to wear and go with most things including jeans, pants and skirts.",
