            "Review Title": "Order the Wide or X-Wide these have a Narrow Fit and Small Toe Box",
            "Review Body": "These shoes fit true to size, however the are narrow and the toe box is confining on the regular version. I recommend ordering the Wide for Regular feet and X-Wide for wider feet.The shoe itself is inexpensive ($99.99) and well made. I normally wear Nike and Merrell shoes but recently developed pain in my 4th & 5th Metatarsal bones (ball of foot) and needed to switch my shoe brand after 10+ years.New Balance was one of the highest recommendations so I bought both a pair of 623 V3 and 608 V5 Casual Comfort Cross Trainers. These shoes were both the #1 Best Sellers according to Amazon in my search.Both shoes are very similar in style apart from some stitching on the top of the toes. The main difference between these two models of shoes is the insole and outer sole. The insole on the 608 has slightly more cushion and memory type foam and the outer sole is with the main difference in the sole has a slightly more aggressive tread pattern. The insole on the 623 is firmer and less aggressive sole tread intended for indoors or smoother surfaces. Your foot rides higher in the ankle on the 623 and lower on the 608.As far as pricing goes there is a $10 difference between the 608 and 623 at the time I purchased them, with the 608 being more expensive.Both shoes are comfortable to wear but I preferred the firmer insole and less stitching on and toe box of the 623 rather than this more expensive 608. I spend 8-15 hours a day on my feet so having a comfortable shoe is essential. These new balance Cross Trainers feel good for about 4-5 hours but after that my feet began to hurt. They do relieve some of my metatarsal pain but not as much as I hoped for. I ended up sending both shoes back and purchase some Saucony Omni Walker 3 and Saucony Exite Le 9 Walking shoes instead. The Saucony's ended up fitting my foot better, were more comforatable to wear for 10+ hours and were lower priced.\u2022\u2022\u2022 Recommendation \u2022\u2022\u2022These New Balance Comfort Cross Trainers are good overall walking/casual training shoes. They are comfortable and reasonably priced. They have a narrow fit so order the Wide or X-Wide size. Lastly check out Saucony Walking Shoes on Amazon as an alternative ... you may just find a more comfortable pair of walking shoes at an even lower price like I did.",

Only this model because they\u2019re wide enough with heavy athletic socks, excellent arch support, good tread and thick sole.
