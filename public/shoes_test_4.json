Their return policy is only 1 month, I made the mistake of purchasing prior to the summer so missed the warranty period. Very surprised on the low quality. Now wearing my old worn Sperry\u2019s again, after spending over $100 on a new pair. I now have a ripped new pair of Sperry\u2019s and I\u2019m out $100.",
