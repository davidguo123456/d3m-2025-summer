They are tremendously light weight, flexible and I use them frequently for shopping and short walks. I did take one star off my rating because I found these shoes (my second pair) run larger than they say. I took a half size smaller and they're perfect.",

            "Review Body": "I bought these for a month if travel through T\u00fcrkiye and Greece and they were the shoes that I wore 95% of the time. Size fits as expected and ordered usual size. Lightweight and breathable with scorching hot temperatures. Thick soles are super comfy on all the cobblestones and uneven surfaces. I was averaging 15-20km of walking a day and these kept my feet happy. Just wear little socks with them. I also bought a little nylon scrubbie at a flea market and was able to wash these with hotel shampoo in the sink, then stuck hair dryer in to dry. I got the taupe so that some dirt/dust wouldn\u2019t show as easily and that colour was perfect and matches all summery outfits.",
